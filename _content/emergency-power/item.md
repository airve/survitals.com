An emergency power source creates the ability to generate power on command in the event of a power grid failure.
With the rise in erratic weather patterns and the evergrowing demand on an outdated energy grid power failures
are becoming more common. These power outages range from a few hours to weeks on end. There are many options
available to provide emergency power to the homeowner and each has its advantages and disadvantages but with
careful planning a proper system can be installed within most budgets.

## Simple Solutions

### Charcoal Grill or Outdoor Fire Pit

The most basic source of emergency power is fire. A simple outdoor fire pit or charcoal grill will allow 
anyone to heat canned food, cook raw meat and vegetables, and most importantly boil water. The grill or fire
pit also creates welcome warmth that can easily raise the spirits and become a focal and rallying point during a 
survival situation. The biggest advantage of a fire pit or charcoal grill is the abundance of fuels that can be 
found almost anywhere. It is possible to burn everything from wood to old tires depending on the situation. 
The biggest problem with an open or contained fire is smoke. Smoke can draw unwanted attention from far away.
It alerts people to your whereabouts and lets them know you have resources they may want.

### Propane Fueled Grills, Stoves, and Burners

Propane can be stored safely for reasonably long periods of time and combusts without producing smoke.
This gives it an advantage over burning wood and other types of scavenged fuels. There are also propane powered 
heaters available that can safely be used inside the home without fear of carbon monoxide poisoning. Most 
homes already have a propane grill and individuals are familiar with purchasing and storing propane. Keeping your
bottle full and having an extra bottle full at all times will give you the confidence that you can boil water for 
drinking and cook food in case of an extended power outage. The only real downside is you need to plan ahead and
make sure you always have propane on hand and in the case of a very long period without power you may not be able 
to refill your bottles.
