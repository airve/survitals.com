<dfn>Situation awareness</dfn> is the ability to observe details about one's 
current surroundings that may be relevant to future needs or dangers.

## Examples

- Noticing storm clouds that may predict weather dangers
- Noticing noxious fumes while their is still time to escape them
- Awareness of nearby vehicles or reckless drivers as to prevent collisions

## Mindset
#### [Stratfor](http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/practical-guide-situational-awareness) suggests situation awareness is more a mindset than a skill:
> The <b>primary</b> element in establishing this mindset is first to recognize that threats exist. 
> Ignorance or denial of a threat make a person's chances of quickly recognizing an emerging 
> threat and avoiding it highly unlikely. Bad things do happen. Apathy, denial and complacency 
> can be deadly. A <b>second</b> important element of the proper mindset is understanding the need to 
> take responsibility for one's own security.

## Factors
- Social contexts can impede situation awareness due to [diffusion of responsibility](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_responsibility)
and [bystander effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander_effect) phenomena. People tend to be more conscious of their surroundings when they are alone.
